# BatchCorrectionThinkingPoints
This repository contains the data and script used to generate the case study example in the manuscript titled "Thinking Points for Effective Batch Correction on Biomedical Data".

The R script provided demonstrates the decision tree workflow put into use. Users can use this case study to observe the effects of hidden batch effects in data and how correcting them can lead to better downstreama analysis outcomes.

The data matrix "DIA_protein_matrix.csv" was obtained from the HCC1806/HS578T dataset in the paper titled "MultiPro: DDA-PASEF and diaPASEF acquired cell line proteomic datasets with deliberate batch effects", which contains two classes and two technical batches.
